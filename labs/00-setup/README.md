## Lab 00 - Setup

**Welcome to the first lab session.**

On this page, you will find a brief introduction for the lab and some administrative information. 

The complete instructions are available in another GitHub repo, which you will **fork** (you will have your copy of the repo hosted on GitHub) and then **clone** (you will have a copy your your fork on your machine).

The repo is available at [SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2015-Labo-00](https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2015-Labo-00).

**Enjoy**.


### Objectives

There are **3 objectives** in this lab:

1. Start the **setup of your environment** for this course. We will not install all the tools required for the labs, but after today you should have the main ones up and running.

2. Introduce the **workflow** that we will use for many labs in this course. In this workflow, you will learn how to use **GitHub** and **git** to get the lab instructions, do your assignment and submit your work. This is a workflow that is very, very similar to what experienced developers do in a professional environment.

3. Present the concepts of **Behavior Driven Development** (BDD), Test Driven Development (TDD) and unit tests. For some of the labs, we will specify what you have to implement by giving you a list of automated tests. At the beginning, all the tests will fail. As you make progress with the assignment, your tests will turn green. When you submit your work, we will run the tests again to evaluate your work.


### Groups

It is very important that everyone has a fully functional environment. It is very important that everyone goes through all the steps of the workflow. For these reasons, we request that you do this lab individually. Of course, you are invited to discuss and help each other, but we expect a deliverable from everyone.

### Deadlines

1. **TODAY**. At the end of the session, you need to have your environment setup. You also must have created your fork on GitHub and cloned it on your machine. Finally, you must have been able to execute the tests with maven (more on this later). **If you have not managed to achieve these key objectives, come to us ASAP.**

2. **On Tuesday, February 24th**, we will make a first evaluation of the results. We will check the forks, run the tests on your code and have a look at the results. **Make sure that you have done a git push** on Monday evening at the latest! This will give us an indication of the class progress. **Please help us** and pay attention to this intermediate milestone!

3. **On Tuesday, March 3rd**, we will do the formal evaluation of your submissions. We will run the automated tests on your forks once again. We will **analyze the number of passing and failing tests**. This will give us a measure of your success.


### Grading

The goal of this first lab is to get familiar with the workflow and the supporting tools. The code that you have to write is trivial. We will not give you a formal grade for the lab. 

**However**, we will keep track of your results and they will be used for the evaluation of your overall performance during the course. But more importantly: if you do not invest enough time in this lab, if you don't understand what is happening and don't master the tools, **you will suffer a lot** during the upcoming labs (and next year).

Please invest the time to achieve the lab objectives. Please come to us and let us know if you have issues or do not understand some of the tasks. If you have questions when you are working outside lab hours or if we are busy with someone else, open a discussion in the moodle forum.
