## Lab 00 - Setup

**Welcome to the first lab session!**

On this page, you will find a brief introduction for the lab and some administrative information. 

The complete instructions are available in another GitHub repo, which you will **fork** (you will have your copy of the repo hosted on GitHub) and then **clone** (you will have a copy your your fork on your machine).

The repo is available at [SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2016-Labo-00](https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2016-Labo-00).

**Enjoy**.


### Objectives

There are **3 objectives** in this lab:

1. Start the **setup of your environment** for this course. We will not install all the tools required for the labs, but after today you should have the main ones up and running.

2. Introduce the **workflow** that we will use for many labs in this course. In this workflow, you will learn how to use **GitHub** and **git** to get the lab instructions, do your assignment and submit your work. This is a workflow that is very, very similar to what experienced developers do in a professional environment.

3. Present the concepts of **Behavior Driven Development** (BDD), Test Driven Development (TDD) and unit tests. For some of the labs, we will specify what you have to implement by giving you a list of automated tests. At the beginning, all the tests will fail. As you make progress with the assignment, your tests will turn green. When you submit your work, we will run the tests again to evaluate your work.


### Groups (or lack thereof...)

It is very important that everyone has a fully functional environment. It is very important that everyone goes through all the steps of the workflow. For these reasons, **we request that you do this lab individually**. Of course, you are invited to discuss and help each other, but we expect a deliverable from everyone.


### Deadlines and grading

1. **TODAY**. At the end of the session, you need to have your environment setup. You also must have created your fork on GitHub and cloned it on your machine. Finally, you must have been able to execute the tests with maven (more on this later). **If you have not managed to achieve these key objectives, come to us ASAP.**

2. **Saturday, February 27th at 23:00 is the first deadline**. We will do a first evaluation of your work. Make sure that you have tested and committed all of your files. We will run automated tests on all of your forks. All students who have all of our tests running successfully at this stage will get their first 6.0 lab grade. This includes the tests that are initially commented out.

3. **On Wednesday, March 2nd**, we will help students who still have failing tests to fix their issues. Depending on the number of students in this situation, we will ask the students who are done with the lab to help their peers.

4. **Friday, March 4th at 14:00 is the final deadline**. We will evaluate the work of students who did not get a 6.0 in the first pass. Be careful: it is easy to get a very good grade for this lab, but if you don't pay attention it is also possible to get a very bad one:

    * If you have not committed any code in your repo, you will get a 1.0.
    * If your code does not compile, you will not get more than a 2.0.
    * If you don't succeed in the first pass, your maximum grade will be 5.0.
    * There are 10 tests. For every passing (green) test, you will get 0.3 points.
    * So, if you have 2 failing tests, your grade will be 2.0 + 8 * 0.3 = 4.4.


### Don't be afraid to ask for help!

The goal of this first lab is to get familiar with the workflow and the supporting tools. The code that you have to write is trivial. 

Please invest the time to achieve the lab objectives and to really understand what you are doing. Please come to us and let us know if you have issues or do not understand some of the tasks. If you have questions when you are working outside lab hours or if we are busy with someone else, open a discussion in the moodle forum.
