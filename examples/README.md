### 01-BufferedIOBenchmark

**Keywords**: lecture 1, java, io, performance, file system

A Java project that illustrates basic IO processing. Different methods to write and read bytes to a file are implemented and compared. Running the program shows big performance differences, depending on how bytes are processed (byte by byte or in blocks, with a buffered stream or not).

### 02-FileIOExample

**Keywords**: lecture 1, java, io, file, filters, read loop, write loop

A Java project that shows the basics of IO processing. The example shows how to read and write bytes from/to a file. The example also shows how to write custom subclasses of `FilterInputStream` and `FilterOutputStream`, to add logic when processing bytes.
